            <b>Net Worth:</b> Together with his famous wife Victoria, David Beckham is thought to have a net worth of
            £450m. Reports indicate that around £370 million of this total is attributed to David Beckham's personal net
            worth. This reflects their financial success as a celebrity couple, with David Beckham's career in sports
            and
            Victoria's in music and fashion contributing significantly to their wealth.

            <p>David Beckham has become exponentially wealthier since he retired from football. Yet, the game continues
              to influence his investments and brand collaborations. He also aligns himself with companies and ideas
              close to his heart.</p>

      <h1>How does David Beckham make money?</h1>
      <p class="textPara">Since retiring from professional soccer, Beckham has made money through various sources.
        Soccer team ownership, automobiles, cannabis, Esports, Forex, Fashion and Property. These show he’s a
        diversified risk-taker involved in many money-spinning interests.</p>
      <h1>How Much Did David Beckham invest in Inter Miami?</h1>
      <p class="textPara">David Beckham is the current president and co-owner of Major League Soccer Club Inter Miami CF. He's also a
      minority shareholder in Salford City Football Club in England.</p>

      <p class="textPara">When Beckham joined Los Angeles Galaxy as a player in 2007, he was awarded the right to a discounted MLS franchise
      as part of his sign-on package. His involvement undoubtedly brought prestige to the brand and riches to his net
      worth.</p>

      <p class="textPara">In 2014, he exercised this right with the announcement of Inter Miami in 2014, for which he reportedly paid $25
      million.</p>

      <p class="textPara">He has since made several investments in the club. Exact figures are hard to come by. However, in February 2021,
      Beckham invested a further $15.3m in the club.</p>

      <p class="textPara">In September 2021, Beckham increased his ownership stake in Inter Miami when he and the Mas brothers finalized the
      buyout of Marcelo Claure and Masayoshi Son. It’s not clear exactly how much Beckham invested at this time. But in
      connection with the buyout announcement Ares Management was also added to the ownership group with an investment
      of $150m.</p>

      <p class="textPara"> With sporting icon Lionel Messi having joined the club in 2023, Inter Miami has seen its value skyrocket. Optus
      Sport says the club is expected to soon be worth more than $1.5bn. This means a huge return on investment for
      Beckham.</p>
      <h1>Cellular Goods (LON: CBX)</h1>
      <p class="textPara"> Cannabinoid company Cellular Goods (LON: CBX) sells health and beauty consumer products based on biosynthetic cannabinoids. The company was founded in August 2018 and went public via IPO in February 2021.</p>
      <p class="textPara"> As of the end of 2021, David Beckham was Cellular Goods' third-biggest shareholder, owning a 4.95% stake in the company. In March 2022 Authentic Brands took a majority stake in David Beckham's DB Ventures, to co-own and manage his global brand. As of August 2023, Authentic Brands had a 2.5% stake in Cellular Goods.</p>
      <p class="textPara">At IPO, Cellular Goods raised gross proceeds of £13m from a conditional placing and an intermediary offer 13 times oversubscribed. It was the first pure-play biosynthetic cannabinoids consumer products company to list on the London Stock Exchange. </p>

      <h1>Cellular Goods (LON: CBX)</h1>
      <p class="textPara">Many of David Beckham’s investments and deals are made through his investment company DB Ventures. This is run by Beckham and his best friend, former football agent David Gardner.

      </p>
      <p class="textPara"> DB Ventures incorporates Beckham’s Haig Club whisky brand, and his endorsement deals with Tudor watches, campaigns with Pepsi, Samsung and Adidas, an agreement with fitness franchisor F45 Training, his investment in Cellular Goods and Lunaz, and his deal to be the face of the Qatar World Cup, 2022.

      </p>
      <p class="textPara">According to media reports, Authentic Brands Group acquired a 55% majority stake in DB Ventures Ltd from Beckham Brand Holdings Ltd for £200m ($270.9m). In January 2021, sources close to David Beckham told the Mail on Sunday that he's selling the stake to pay off debt, allow some partners to exit, and free up capital, and said that the valuation for the company is "unexpectedly high."

      </p>
      <p class="textPara">Authentic Brands represents Shaquille O’Neal and owns the license rights to international icons like Marilyn Monroe and Muhammad Ali.

      </p>
      <p class="textPara"> Rumors of an Authentic Brands IPO have circulated for some time, but the company has withdrawn plans in the past. Instead, it agreed to sell a stake in the business to private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and HPS Investment Partners. This valued Authentic Brands at $12.7bn, including debt.

      </p>
      <p class="textPara"> Authentic Brands founder and CEO Jamie Salter says an IPO could still be coming in the next couple of years.
